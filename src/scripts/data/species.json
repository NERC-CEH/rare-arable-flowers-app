There is often a single flower located in the base of the stem branch immediately below the flower clusters which is the first to flower and set fruit. The seeds are the distinguishing characteristic. Broad-fruited cornsalad seeds are grape-pip like and swollen 2mm long by 1.5mm wide. All of the teeth are short at the apex of the fruit.","map":"images/maps/Valerianella_rimosa.svg","color":["w"],"soil":"Calcareous sandy, clay and chalky loams.","germination_period":"Spring and Autumn","common_name_significant":"Cornsalad","common_name":"Broad-fruited","seed_longevity":"Long-lived","conservation_status":"Endangered   ","gallery":"","flowering_period":"June - August  ","management":"Uncropped cultivated plots (annual)<br/>  Cereal headland<br/>  Unsprayed cereals<br/>  Unsprayed root crops<br/>  Wildlife cover  <br/> Greening fallow land","profile_pic_author":"Cath Shellswell","taxon":" Valerianella rimosa","id":113,"confusion":"other Valerianella spp.","type":"F"},{"profile_pic":"images/pics/Veronica_agrestis.jpg","description":"Sprawling plant with branched, softly hairy stems.
