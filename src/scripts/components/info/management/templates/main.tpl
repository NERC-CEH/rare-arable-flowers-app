    <p>The same basic principles of good agricultural management are also
      applicable to the successful conservation of rare arable flowers in
      modern farming systems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Seed bed comprising a firm, fine tilth in spring or autumn</p></li>
      <li><p>Variation of management periodically to benefit the greatest
          number of species</p></li>
      <li><p>Management of undesirable species where necessary</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cultivation</strong> – many rare arable plants have long-lived
      seed banks buried in the soil. Inversion tillage (ploughing) is a good
      way of bringing this seed to the surface and rejuvenating the population.
      Once the plants have set seed, ploughing then helps to replenish the seed
      bank through the soil profile and bury problem weeds. However, some species,
      such as
      <a href="#species/109">spreading hedge-parsley</a>,
      have short-lived seeds, and, thus prefer reduced tillage. From a practical conservation
      perspective it is therefore best to vary the depth and timing of tillage
      to provide benefits to the maximum number of species. However, it is
      always good to include ploughing into the
      cultivation plan, at least every third or fourth year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Seed beds</strong> – good quality seed beds are important for
      establishing rare arable plants. They have small seeds and therefore
      require a weed-free seed bed with a firm, fine tilth to maximise their
      chances of survival. As for a crop, rolling the seed bed is important to
      ensure adequate contact with moisture and improved germination.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Season</strong> – like crops, rare arable plants establish
      best in autumn or spring (see individual species accounts). They are
      annuals so must be given the opportunity to complete their lifecycle
      in one growing season. It is especially important they are allowed to
      flower and set seed from mid-summer to September. Unless you need to
      manage for a specific rare species, it is good practice to vary the
      season of cultivation (spring, autumn) to benefit the most species.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Weed management</strong> – some areas managed for rare arable
      plants can become weedy with undesirable species like sterile brome and
      thistles. If cover of such species is particularly dense they will need
      to be managed. There are several practical options to achieve this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>Inversion</b> – ploughing is a good way of burying problem species
          (and uncovering seed banks of rare plants). Alternation of ploughing
          and reduced tillage is good practice.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Herbicides</b>* – application of herbicides can wipe out rare
          arable plants so only apply where necessary and seek advice from a
          qualified agronomist and your Scheme Advisor. Appropriate product
          selection will vary according to the rare species and the problem
          weeds. Spot application and weed wiping can be helpful in controlling
          some weed infestations. Application of broad-spectrum herbicide after
          the rare species have set seed is a good means of controlling perennial
          weeds like creeping thistle.
        </p>
        <small>* Always follow the instructions on the product label when applying herbicide.</small>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Topping</b> – topping > 30cm is a useful technique to prevent
          seeding of undesirable species such as wild oats and creeping thistle
          during the growing season where there is a good height difference
          between the rare species and the problem weeds.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Locations</strong> – Areas managed for arable plants offer
      conservation benefits in both fixed or rotated locations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>Rotation</b> – this can help reduce the build-up of undesirable weeds on arable
          plant areas and also spreads the benefit of uncropped cultivated
          areas around the whole farm, and fits in with farming operations
          such as inversion tillage, and crop rotations.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Fixed locations</b> – for known populations of rare species it can
          be beneficial to fix the location of cultivated areas to ensure
          continued survival of scarce species. In addition, over time, fixed
          areas should create lower fertility conditions favoured by these species.
