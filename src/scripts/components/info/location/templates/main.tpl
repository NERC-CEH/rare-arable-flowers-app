    <p>Check with the interactive map (below) to see if your farm is in a rare
      arable plant ‘hotspot’ – if you have rare plants on your farm
      there could well be more!</p>

  <li>
    <p>Rare arable plants tend to occur on parts of the farm that have received
      lower inputs of herbicide and fertiliser, for example, field edges,
      awkward corners, land adjacent to old tracks etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rare arable plants can be found on a range of soil types but
      they thrive where fertility is lower and where there is less pressure
      from competitive weeds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grassland and old grass margins that were once arable may
      still have a seed bank of rare plants.</p>
