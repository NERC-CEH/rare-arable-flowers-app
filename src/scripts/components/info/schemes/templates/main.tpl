    <p>There are many opportunities to manage for arable plants that are
      supported by payments or advice. These include the Basic Payment Scheme,
      agri-nvironment schemes and the Campaign for the Farmed Environment.
      Each of these have their own rules and eligibility criteria so please
      ensure you are fully compliant with them.

        <p>Basic Payment Scheme habitats eligible as Ecological Focus Areas (EFA)
          such as catch and cover crops, and fallow land can be managed
          sympathetically for rare arable plants.</p>

        <p>There are a range of specific management measures which can be used
          to effectively conserve arable plants. Key management activities are
          summarized below and may be available as agri-environment scheme options.</p>

      <p>Research suggests the most effective means of conserving rare arable
        plants is to remove field edges or corners from crop production either
        on a rotational or permanent basis and cultivate each year to ensure
        regeneration of rare arable plants. This habitat is especially suited
        to smaller cornfield flowers, such as
        <a href="#species/3">ground-pine</a>,
        <a href="#species/1">pheasantâ€™s-eye</a>,
        <a href="#species/103">small-flowered catchfly</a> and
        <a href="#species/101">annual knawel</a>, that cannot
        compete with modern crops. The diversity of flowers produced by this
        management provide vitally important pollen and nectar resources for
        bees and other insects. Do not apply fertilisers and only use herbicides
        <a href="#mgmtconservation">where absolutely necessary</a>. It is often best to rotate
        the location of these patches to avoid the build-up of undesirable weeds.
        Below is a summary of some of the options under agri-environment schemes
        to provide this habitat:</p>
