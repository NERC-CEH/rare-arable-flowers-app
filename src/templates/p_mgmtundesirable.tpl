      <p>The same basic principles of good agricultural management should
        be applied to the successful conservation of rare arable flowers
        in modern farming systems:</p>
      <ol class="list-normal-white-space">
        <li><p>Seed bed comprising a firm, fine tilth in spring or autumn</p></li>
        <li><p>Management of competition from undesirable species</p></li>
        <li><p>Rotation to avoid build-up of problem species</p></li>
        <li><p>Variation of management to benefit the greatest number of species</p></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Season</strong> – like crops, rare arable plants establish best in the autumn or
        spring (see individual species accounts). They are annuals so must be
        given the opportunity to complete their lifecycle in one season. It is
        especially important they are allowed to flower and set seed from mid-summer
        to September. Unless you need to manage for a specific rare species, it is
        good practice to vary the season of cultivation (spring, autumn) to
        benefit the most species.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Cultivation</strong> – many rare arable plants have long-lived seed banks buried
        in the soil. Inversion tillage (ploughing) is a good way of bringing this
        seed to the surface and rejuvenating the population. Once the plants are
        established, ploughing then helps to replenish the seed bank through the
        soil profile and bury problem weeds. However, some species have short-lived
        seeds, such as <a href="#species/109">spreading hedge-parsley</a> and prefer reduced tillage.
        From a practical conservation perspective it is therefore best to vary
        the depth and timing of tillage to provide benefits to the maximum number
        of species. However, it is always good to have a relatively frequent
        ploughing into the cultivation plan, at least every third or fourth year.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Seed beds</strong> – good quality seed beds are important for establishing rare
        arable plants. They have small seeds and therefore require a weed-free
        seed bed with a firm, fine tilth to maximise their chances of survival.
        As for a crop, rolling the seed bed is important to ensure adequate
        contact with moisture and improve germination.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Weed management</strong> – most areas managed for rare arable plants will build-up
        populations of undesirable species like sterile brome and thistles.
        These can smoother the rare species so need to be managed. There are
        several practical options:</p>
      <ul class="list-normal-white-space">
        <li>
          <p><b>Inversion</b> – as for a crop, ploughing is a good way of
            burying problem species (and uncovering seed banks of rare plants),
            but its effectiveness diminishes with time. Alternation of ploughing
            and reduced tillage is the best practice.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Herbicides</b>* – application of herbicides can wipe out rare arable
            plants so only apply where necessary and seek advice from your Scheme
            Advisor if in doubt. Localised weed infestations can by controlled by
            spot application. Some grass weeds can be controlled with label approved
            graminicides. It may be possible to control some broad-leaved weeds
            with selective herbicides. Application of broad-spectrum herbicide at
            harvest time (after the rare species have set seed) is a good means
            of controlling perennial weeds like creeping thistle.
          </p>
          <small>* Always follow the instructions on the product label when applying herbicide.</small>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Rotation</strong> – moving the location of rare arable plant conservation areas
        around the farm is good practice for three important reasons:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-normal-white-space">
        <li><p>helps reduce the build-up of undesirable weeds</p></li>
        <li><p>spreads the benefits of conservation around the whole farm, and</p></li>
        <li><p>makes it easier to fit
          in with farming operations, for example coupling conservation to certain
          crops in the rotation that require inversion tillage, or spring sowing.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
