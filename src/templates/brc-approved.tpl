            <p>You might have noticed that several of
                <a href="http://www.brc.ac.uk/apps" rel="external">BRC apps</a>
                feature some of the same species?  We have introduced the BRC Approved
                logo to signify that data from our apps all go to the same place.
                Therefore, you are free to choose which app you use to record a given species.
                All records will be sent to the same place, treated in the same way and will meet
                the established standards required by the Biological  Record Centre.</p>
