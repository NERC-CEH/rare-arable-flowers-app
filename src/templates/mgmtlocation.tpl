                <p>Most arable flower species were introduced with agricultural crops from mainland Europe which means fields with a long history of cultivation (100yrs or more) are ideal sites to consider managing for arable flowers. Fields and margins which have been converted to grass in the past but were previously arable (e.g. old grass margins) should also be considered, particularly where there are previous records of arable plant species.</p>
                <p>The richest areas for arable flowers tend to be adjacent to old field boundaries and historic farm tracks. Creating the right habitat for arable flowers up to 6m away from the field edge are some of the best ways to conserve them.
                    Cool and shady field areas and northern sides of woodland and large hedges are generally not suitable places as they can be harder to manage.</p>
                <p>Sites with low levels of undesirable weeds such as couch, black-grass, brome, ryegrass and wild oats are easier to manage, although in some instances are unavoidable where target plant populations and species are found.</p>
