                <p>Conserving arable flowers is quite easy. The seeds of some arable flowers can persist in the soil for years. Providing the right conditions for them to grow is often all you need do to reveal species thought to have vanished years ago! In addition this habitat is rich in pollen and nectar and can provide a vital summer resource for pollinators and other insects as well as foraging areas for farmland bird species such as Grey Partridge. Information on the requirements of specific species can be found in the species accounts.</p>

                <strong>Uncropped Cultivated Land areas:</strong>
                <p>Aim to create an area of fine seedbed either in the spring or autumn, depending on the target species (see species guide) and then allow a natural cover to develop. </p>

                <p>Less intensive management of crops on a field scale can also benefit arable flowers.</p>

                <p>Areas of un-cropped fallow land utilised under the new Basic Payment Scheme as part of the Crop diversification rules and Environmental Focus Areas greening requirements can provide suitable conditions for many arable plant species.</p>
                <p>Arable flowers are essentially plants of disturbed ground. Therefore other farm activities which provide disturbed ground at the relevant times of year can allow arable plants to flourish.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Wild bird seed mixes- grown predominantly to provide winter seeds for farmland birds but can also have a rich arable flora.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Summer fallows, used as break crop can provide a window of opportunity for arable flowers to germinate and set seed.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Cereal stubbles, particularly those of a spring crop can provide extended flowering and seeding conditions for later species of arable flowers.</p>

                <strong>Managing undesirable species:</strong>
                <p>With any habitat that encourages arable flowers there is always the potential for other, less desirable weed species to develop. The following methods of control can be used to help control these species without negatively affecting the arable flowers.</p>
                <p>Topping un-cropped areas at a height of 1ft or more can be used to prevent seeding of undesirable weed species, such wild oats, creeping thistle during the growing season as many desirable arable species will be shorter than this and be unaffected by the cut.</p>
                <p>Rotating the un-cropped areas around the farm can help control and prevent a build-up of undesirable weed species.</p>
                <p>Varying the cultivation timing and depth can help control undesirable species whilst providing a range of conditions for both spring and autumn germinating arable plants.</p>
                <p>Sterile Brome and Black-grass can be controlled by ploughing to 15cm or more.</p>
                <p>Black-grass can also be controlled by swapping from an autumn to a spring cultivation periodically.</p>
                <p>For margins/plots which remain in the same place every year strategic use of graminicides against grass weed species that cannot be controlled by cultivation  may be required. Similarly the periodic use (once every 3-5 years) of broad spectrum herbicide after the flowering period can be applied to control injurious weeds.</p>
                <p>N.B. Where management may involve chemical treatments please ensure specialist advice and all label recommendations are observed</p>
