            <p>Conserving arable flowers is quite easy. The seeds of some arable
                flowers can persist in the soil for years. Providing the right
                conditions for them to grow is often all you need do to reveal
                species thought to have vanished years ago! In addition this
                habitat is rich in pollen and nectar and can provide a vital
                summer resource for pollinators and other insects as well as
                foraging areas for farmland bird species such as Grey Partridge.
                Information on the requirements of specific species can be found
                in the species accounts.</p>
