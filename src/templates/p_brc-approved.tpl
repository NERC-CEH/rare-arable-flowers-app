            <p><strong>About BRC</strong></p>
            <p>
                The <a href="http://www.brc.ac.uk" rel="external">Biological Records Centre</a> (BRC), established in 1964, is a national
                focus in the UK for terrestrial and freshwater species recording.
                BRC works closely with the voluntary recording community, principally
                through support of national recording schemes and societies. BRC is
                supported by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and the
                Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) within the Natural Environment
                Research Council (NERC). The work of BRC is a major component of the
                National Biodiversity Network (NBN).</p>

            <p><strong>Which app should I use?</strong></p>

            <p>You might have noticed that several of
                <a href="http://www.brc.ac.uk/apps" rel="external">BRC apps</a>
                feature some of the same species?  We have introduced the BRC Approved
                logo to signify that data from our apps all go to the same place.
                Therefore, you are free to choose which app you use to record a given species.
                All records will be sent to the same place, treated in the same way and will meet
                the established standards required by the Biological  Record Centre.</p>
