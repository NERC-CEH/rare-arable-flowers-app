            <p>Managing land for arable flowers is very easy. The seeds of some can persist in the soil for years. Providing the right conditions for germination is often all you need. Plants thought to have vanished years ago can come back and flourish! It is also a habitat rich in pollen and nectar providing a vital summer resource for pollinators and other insects. These in turn are eaten by farmland birds and the seeds provide food throughout the winter. Information on the requirements of specific arable plants can be found in the species accounts.</p>

            <h4>Uncropped Cultivated Land</h4>
            <img src="images/option_27.png">

            <p>Some arable flowers survive on the edges and in the corners of cultivated fields. These are locations that may not have been sprayed with herbicide in the past and may also have been missed by fertilisers. To mimic this management, uncropped cultivated plots and margins are the best management. Most arable plants respond favourably to this management, but it is especially suited to flowers that can’t compete with modern cropping, such as <a href="#species/3">ground-pine</a>, <a href="#species/1">pheasant’s-eye</a>, <a href="#species/103">small-flowered catchfly</a> and <a href="#species/101">annual knawel</a>. </p>

            <p>Aim to create a fine seedbed either in the spring or autumn, depending on the target species (see species guide), and then allow a natural cover to develop. </p>
            <ul class="list-normal-white-space">
                <li>
                    <p>Plough and press the surface. Where required undertake a further surface cultivation, such as disc- or tine-harrowing, or non-inversion techniques using cultivating equipment, for example heavy discs or power harrows. The aim is to create a fine tilth, so that seeds brought to the soil surface can germinate and take root. Minimum tillage does not disturb the soil surface sufficiently to bring seed to the surface and can leave a green cover, particularly grasses and perennial weeds that can swamp the margin.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Leave the margins to develop a green cover naturally. There is no need to fertilise or sow a crop as the arable plants will naturally regenerate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Herbicides will kill the arable flowers and shouldn’t be used.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Try and leave the cultivated plots and/or margins as long as possible. Arable plants will flower long into the autumn letting them complete their lifecycle and set seed. Also, some of the common plants associated with arable habitat, such as red dead-nettle, can flower early in the spring providing an early nectar resource for insects, particularly bees, coming out of hibernation. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The majority of arable flowers are annual, but a few are biennial (forming a rosette in the first year, flowering in the second year to complete their lifecycle and then dying) and will require cultivations once every two years. For example, <a href="#species/85">cat-mint</a> is a biennial flower.</p>

            <h4>Cereal Headlands</h4>
            <img src="images/option_34B.png">

            <p>Some arable flowers, such as <a href="#species/100">shepherds-needle</a> and <a href="#species/94">corn buttercup</a>, will thrive in a situation which mimics historical cropping patterns. These plants can grow within crops as well as along the edges of crops, and can compete with modern cereal varieties that are sown at a reduced drill rate and have less fertiliser.</p>
            <p>Aim to create a widely spaced low-input cereal crop along the field margin:</p>
            <ul class="list-normal-white-space">
                <li>
                    <p>Plough and press the surface.

Minimum tillage does not disturb the soil surface sufficiently to bring seed to the surface and can leave a green cover, particularly grasses and perennial weeds, which can swamp the margin.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sow and manage an area of cereal headland. This can be any width but usually between 6-24m.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sowing a reduced rate of cereal (usually less than 100Kg/ha) can provide optimal crop density allowing arable flowers room between the cereal stalks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Many arable flowers do not like extremely fertile conditions, and the cereal can take over and shade-out the flowers if it is applied. Under this management it is not advised to fertilise the headland so that the flowers can compete with the cereal crop. Other treatments, such as lime, can also affect the survival of arable plants, and some flowers that like freely-draining soils, particularly sandy soils, may like slightly more acidic soils. The occasional application of lime may be needed to make sure that the soil does not turn too acidic.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Herbicides will kill the arable flowers and shouldn’t be used.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the headland is to be harvested, a pre-harvested desiccant could be applied. Unharvested cereal headlands can be left in place over the winter to provide a seed source for farmland birds that will eat both the cereal grain and seeds from the arable flowers.</p>

            <p>Less intensive management of crops on a field scale can also benefit arable flowers.
